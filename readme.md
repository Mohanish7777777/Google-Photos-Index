# Google Photos Indexer

A Laravel package providing console commands to maintain a local copy of a Google Photos account.

This can serve as both a backup and, by using the [Slideshow](https://github.com/dmlogic/photo-slideshow) tool, a rolling randomised display on your TV.

The indexer is only interested in photos you have placed in an album. The intention is that you have to denote the image as special enough to copy down. Random phone shots that get sync'd don't make the cut.
